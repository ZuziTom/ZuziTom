# Techniques Used in MS EXCEL Data Analysis Projects

## 1. Data Cleaning, processing and standardization
Purpose: Ensure data quality and consistency for accurate analysis.
Steps:
- Handle missing values: Impute or remove missing data appropriately.
- Remove duplicates: Ensure each data entry is unique.
- Correct data formats: Convert data types to ensure uniformity.
- Merge data from various tables (XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP).
- Creating new variables.
- Normalize data: Adjust data scales to a common range (e.g., 0-1) for fair comparison.
- Standardize variables: Convert data into standard units (e.g., z-scores) to understand relative distributions.

EXEL FUNCTIONS: IF, AND, OR, ISBLANK, IFERROR, INDEX, MATCH, and filtering capabilities, Remove Duplicates feature or COUNTIF function, TEXT, VALUE, DATEVALUE, TEXT TO COLUMNS, Power Query (Get & Transform Data), Filter and Sort, Conditional Formatting tab, Data Validation under Data tab

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Purpose: Summarize main characteristics of the data and uncover patterns.
Steps:
- Descriptive statistics: Calculate measures like average, sum, count, median, mode, standard deviation, range, variance
- Data distribution: Visualize data using histograms, box plots, etc., to understand its distribution.
- Identify outliers: Detect and handle outliers that may skew analysis.
- Pivot Tables: Summarize and aggregate data for detailed analysis and reporting (easy manipulation and visualization of data subsets)

EXCEL FUNCTIONS/FEATURES: FILTER, SORT, UNIQUE, SEQUENCE, AVERAGE, SUM, COUNT, MEDIAN, MODE, STDEV, range (MAX - MIN), VAR, Histogram chart, Box and Whisker Plot chart, PivotTable and PivotChart, Data Table feature to perform what-if analysis

## 4. In-Depth analysis 
Purpose: Advanced techniques beyond basic data exploration to uncover deeper insights and relationships within the data. Present data visually to facilitate understanding and decision-making.
Techniques:
- Scatter Plots - Identify correlations (positive, negative, or none) between variables. Assess the fit of linear models to understand predictive relationships.
- Linear Regression - Understand the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable. Choose variables that may influence the outcome. Calculate coefficients that best fit the data.
- Correlation - Quantify relationships between variables. Pearson correlation to measure linear relationships. Assess suitability of variables for regression modeling based on correlation strength.

EXCEL FEATURES: Data Analysis ToolPak, Scatter chart, linear models (TREND, FORECAST), understand the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable using LINEST, calculate coefficients that best fit the data; CORREL (Pearson correlation), assess suitability of variables for regression modeling based on correlation strength, Sparklines feature, 

## 5. Data Visualization
Purpose: Present data visually to facilitate understanding and decision-making.
Techniques:
- Charts and graphs: Use various types (bar, pie, line charts) to display trends and comparisons.
- Interactive visuals: Create dynamic displays to explore complex datasets.
- Storytelling: Communicate findings effectively through visual narratives.

EXCEL FEATURES: Use various types (bar (Bar Chart), pie (Pie Chart), line (Line Chart)) to display trends and comparisons;  dynamic displays using Slicer, Timeline; communicate findings effectively through visual narratives using Chart Titles, Labels, and annotations.

## Application Across Projects
1. Automotive Data Analysis Project: Utilized correlation analysis to understand dependencies between car features and sales performance.
2. Spotify Data Analysis Project: Applied linear regression to predict song popularity based on musical attributes identified through EDA and correlation analysis.
3. AB Test Projects: Evaluated the impact of feature changes using statistical analysis and correlation to measure effectiveness.
4. McDonald's Nutritional Analysis Project: Provided detailed insights into the nutritional profile of McDonald's menu items through statistical analysis and visualizations.

## Conclusion
These techniques collectively form a robust framework for conducting data analysis across various domains. They enable analysts to explore data comprehensively, derive meaningful insights, and make informed decisions based on empirical evidence. Each technique plays a crucial role in different stages of the analysis process, from data cleaning and exploration to modeling and visualization, ensuring rigorous and insightful data-driven conclusions.
